## Are we living another tech transition?


Ok, you probably already know about chatGPT at this point. That language model is great and I use it every day to help me do my stuff and learn to program, but, as someone who likes cyberpunk culture, it makes me wonder how the future is going to look like if this kind of technology evolves even more and gets popular amongst other people. Just a few years ago, most people did not have smartphones and now, they are an integral part of our lives. In a similar way, we are currently in a transition period where LLMs are becoming accessible.

LLMs are artificial intelligence models that are trained on vast amounts of data to generate human-like language. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world, making most things easier and more efficient. I really hope that in the future, using these AIs as virtual assistants is going to be something normal. I would love to be able to host my own artificial intelligence at home and make it adapt to my needs as I interact with it. We'll see more and more LLMs being integrated into our daily lives and they are going to be better and better. Just like how we couldn't imagine life without smartphones, in the near future, we will not be able to imagine life without LLMs.

I just read Google's announcement on Bard, and Microsoft is investing millions into ChatGPT. That's great, even though I dislike most of these big tech companies because of their profit model, I think that these investments are going to impact the world in a positive way. 

The same way schools took years to let students make use of smartphones and tablet to assist with education, I think that the same will happen with LLMs, which is a shame, but I truly believe that LLMs can be incredibly useful for both students and teachers in the learning process. For students, these models can provide personalized, real-time support for their needs. A student who is struggling with a particular subject can receive instant help from AI. The virtual assistant can create explanations, examples, and exercises that are in the student's level.

For teachers, LLMs can be an effective tool for grading and assessment. With their ability to understand and analyze vast amounts of data, these models can quickly and accurately grade students' work, freeing up teachers to focus on other important tasks like planning lessons or helping them. They can make the teacher's job easier and more efficient.

In order for LLMs to be used effectively in schools, there are a few things that need to be considered. First and foremost, it's important to have proper training and education for both students and teachers on how to use these models (we saw how some people were struggling to participate in virtual classes during the pandemic) and schools need to be equipped with the necessary technology to make it all work. This might include things like good internet, good devices, and specialized software.

All I want is to see what the future is going to look like.

        <h1 id="how-to-do-osint---a-brief-introduction.">How to do OSINT - A brief introduction.</h1>
        <p>This is a collection of everything I have learned about OSINT from various resources over the internet. Be
            aware
            that
            some of the tools presented here may change or stop working with time, which is normal. The most important
            thing
            you
            should get out of this is <strong>to learn the methods used and be able to replicate them.</strong></p>
        <p>The goal of this guide is to show the path one should follow when doing research on a target. The guide is
            divided in
            different sections covering a wide range of topics. Each one of them has their own tools that I recommend
            and
            use.
        </p>
        <p>This page will be updated with time as I find new resources and new tools. Happy hacking.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-osint">What is OSINT?</h2>
        <p>Open-source intelligence is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt and
            publicly
            available sources) to produce actionable intelligence. OSINT is primarily used in national security, law
            enforcement, and business intelligence functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive
            intelligence
            in
            answering classified unclassified, or proprietary intelligence requirements across the previous intelligence
            disciplines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">Read more.</a></p>
        <p><strong>OSINT is the first phase of hacking.</strong></p>
        <h2 id="keeping-your-data-safe">Keeping your data safe</h2>
        <p>Before starting, it is important to make sure that your data is secure and that you won’t reveal your true
            identity.
            Ideally, we are not going to interact directly with our target, but it is always essential to stay secure.
        </p>
        <h3 id="password-managers">Password managers</h3>
        <p>You want to keep the information you are collecting <strong>as private as possible.</strong> In order to do
            that,
            it
            is essential to use a password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden.</a></p>
        <p>Other tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate a strong password and use it for only one account.</li>
            <li>Enable 2FA.</li>
            <li>Don’t save passwords in browsers.</li>
            <li>Never answer online security questions truthfully, since those are vulnerable to social engineering.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid using SMS for 2FA.</li>
            <li>Consider unique usernames.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="secure-email">️Secure email</h3>
        <p>Another significant step is to use a secure email provider that offers encryption, such as <a
                href="https://protonmail.com/">Protonmail.</a></p>
        <p>Other tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your email address private</li>
            <li>Disable automatic loading of remote content</li>
            <li>Don’t share sensitive data via email. You can use <a href="https://onionshare.org/">onionshare</a> to
                share
                sensitive files.</li>
            <li>Use aliasing/anonymous forwarding (ex: <a
                    href="https://simplelogin.io/?slref=bridsqrgvrnavso">SimpleLogin</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
        <p>Before backing up your data in the cloud, it is encouraged to encrypt it. For that, you can use <a
                href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator.</a></p>
        <h3 id="sock-puppets">Sock Puppets</h3>
        <p>A sock puppet is a fake identity you assume on the internet so that you don’t give out your real data.
            <strong>This
                should never link back to your true identity.</strong> Sock puppets should look real and be active
            online to
            look more legitimate.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You must generate a fake profile and add fake data to it.</strong> This data should be the same
            across
            all
            the sock puppets’ accounts. Remember: women are better at social engineering. Don’t use other people’s
            photos,
            because that could be easily reverse searched. You can use something like <a
                href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">this person does not exist</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sock puppets are of extreme importance in case you are investigating dangerous people.</li>
            <li>If it is affordable to you, you should use burner phones and computers to manage the accounts.</li>
            <li>Use a VPN instead of your real IP address.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="searches">Searches</h2>
        <p>Now it’s time to talk about search engines and how to better utilize them. When we are searching for
            something on
            Google, for example, it is very common to find a bunch of irrelevant and messy results. When we are doing an
            OSINT
            investigation, it is important to filter the good results from the bad ones. That’s why we use something
            called
            search operators.</p>
        <h3 id="search-operators">Search operators</h3>
        <p>There are a number of commands you can use to refine your search results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Results about cats or dogs</p>
                <p><code>cats dogs</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Results for exact term “cats and dogs”. If no results are found, related results will be shown.</p>
                <p><code>"cats and dogs"</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fewer dogs in results</p>
                <p><code>cats -dogs</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Find subdomains of dogs.com</p>
                <p><code>site:dogs.com -www</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>More dogs in results</p>
                <p><code>cats +dogs</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>PDFs about cats. Supported file types: pdf, doc(x), xls(x), ppt(x), html</p>

                <p><code>cats -site:example.com</code></p>
            </li>

                <p><code>cats AND dogs</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pages include the word “cats” OR “dogs”</p>
                <p><code>cats OR dogs</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3 id="for-people">For people</h3>
        <p>If you are looking for a specific person, a good way to start is to look for the person’s name on a search
            engine. If
            you want something more specific, you can go over to <a href="https://whitepages.com/">whitepages</a> or <a

        <h3 id="for-businesses">For businesses</h3>
        <p>If you are doing OSINT on a business, the first place to look at is their website and social media, specially
            LinkedIn.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check for company directory in the URL, news, forums, phone numbers, employees, and their positions,
                photos
                and
                what is contained in them</li>
            <li>If you look for photos you might be able to get some data from your target, such as sticky notes,
                operating
                systems and metadata.</li>
            <li>Look for the company name in a government website that can give you some legal data, such as directors,
                CEOs
                and
                other names.</li>

        <p>For searching phone numbers, you can first look for them on Google and see what comes out. If you don’t get
            interesting results, try searching with hifens, area codes or even spell the numbers. Play with the syntax.

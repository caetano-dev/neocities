        <p>I have been trying to find the perfect tech niche for me to specialize in. I have already looked into
            frontend, backend, artificial intelligence, devops, cybersecurity, mobile and a variety of other stuff. Why
            is it so hard the sweet spot? I think that the best choice here will be to chose backend development,
            because it is the position that fulfills most of the things I like in IT and doesn&#39;t have the negative
            aspects of the other ones.</p>
        <p>Frontend? That&#39;s what I know the most, but I don&#39;t think having a career in this position it that
            good. It can be fun, but I want something that is more related to coding than design.
            Artificial intelligence? Pays well, but I find it boring.
            Devops? same as AI.
            Cybersecurity? It would be my choice, if I didn&#39;t have to spend so much money with certifications.
            Mobile? My computer doesn&#39;t have enough RAM to run an emulator.</p>
        <p>And I a sure that there are other topics I forgot to mention here that I have already considered. But why
            backed? Simple: Pays well, makes me write code, overlaps with some frontend knowledge and has a bunch of
            resources for me to learn from.</p>
        <p>So I decided I&#39;ll be following <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend">this roadmap</a> for the next months
            and try to learn every topic mentioned here. I know it will take a long time, that&#39;s why I will learn
            the topics, and not all the technologies listed there.</p>
        <p>Wish me luck.</p>

                Quick thoughts on Patrick Dixon's "How AI will change your life"
            </h2>
            <p>
                These are some of my thoughs (maybe a quick review?) after
                reading Patrick Dixon's book on AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                His book is a great introduction to the topic for people who are
                still not familiar with what artificial intelligence is, and it
                shows a wide range of real world applications of AI as well as
                the author's predictions for the future. Patrick Dixon is a
                futurist and has been writing about the future of the world for
                many years. Since I am a programmer and particularly interested
                in LLMs and generative AI, I figured his book would be a good
                read.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the book, Dixon starts by explaining what
                artificial intelligence is and how it works. He then goes on to
                show us "reality checks" on how AI is already changing our
                lives, how it can evolve, but also outlines the risks and
                challenges that come with it, as well as its limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from his predictions, I believe that one of the best parts
                of this books is when Dixon talks about how AI is already being
                used in the real world. For example, he mentions how AI is being
                used in healthcare to diagnose diseases, in agriculture to
                monitor crops, in finance to detect fraud, and in transportation
                to optimize routes. I find a lot of what he presents inspiring
                and serves to show how much computer science can help other
                areas and how integrated software is in our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                About his predictions, I think that most of them are plausible,
                and well balanced, specially during the first two thirds of the
                book. The only issue I have with some of his predictions is that
                in many cases he says that "Super Smart AI" (and he uses this
                term a lot) will be able to do absolutely crazy things without
                an explanation on how or when.
            </p>
            <p>
                For exaple, in many parts of the book he mentions that "Super
                smart AI" will be able to hack into government systems and go
                rogue if it figures that it is in its best interest to do so. My
                problem with these predictions is that the author implies that
                the more advanced AI gets, the more likely to develop
                consciousnes it is. Artificial intelligence is "just"
                statistics, linear algebra and calculus. It is a piece of
                software and it is not capable of "feeling like doing stuff".
                How and why would a computer program feel like it is in its best
                interest to do anything it was not meant to do? How would a
                computer program have will? Why would AI want to dominate the
                world? For humans, this question is easy to be answered. For
                ones and zeros, it does not matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, here are some parts of the book that I found particularly
                interesting and decided to outline:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The more AI takes over, the more our communities will crave
                    real social contact, in small groups and crowds. We see this
                    in music festivals, football stadiums, theatres, coffee
                    shops, restaurants, and pubs. As we discovered during COVID,
                    ‘virtual’ is a poor substitute for hanging out with family
                    or friends.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AI will get better at imitating, but you can be sure that in
                    2050 there will still be competitive advantage for companies
                    in many industries that (still) offer a personal touch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hundreds of millions of people in hot and humid megacities
                    are living in shacks of wood, plastic, and metal sheet,
                    often without shade, shelter from storms, drainage, or
                    reliable power. Many have access to smartphones and see our
                    more affluent way of life on their screens, firing up hopes
                    and dreams, but their own lives will not be impacted much by
                    AI anytime soon, compared to wealthier citizens in cities of
                    the same country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All leadership works by promising the future will be better
                    in some way, and all marketing works by promising buyers
                    that their own ‘world’ will be improved as a direct result
                    of their own decision to purchase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Imagine you are walking down the street, wondering which way
                    to turn. Post-op, you have learned to pay attention to vague
                    notions that are hard to explain. You just have a ‘gut feel’
                    that the next turning is the one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are wearing a bodycam and pass someone who feels
                    intuitively familiar. You have learned that such feelings
                    mean you may have friends in common, or work in a similar
                    job. After some time, you find that if you really
                    concentrate, the right word or phrase often just ‘comes to
                    mind’.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The future will be all about personal attention, not just
                    being ultra-smart. When we focus on another person, a
                    natural bond is formed. So how rewarding will tomorrow’s
                    eighty-five-year-old find it to be listened to by a machine?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Yet, in almost every school globally, it is still the case
                    that exam answers are written with pen and paper. The same
                    is true in almost all colleges and universities. Future
                    generations will think this was completely ridiculous and
                    negligent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most teenagers in countries like the US, France, and Germany
                    feed themselves digitally from the moment of waking until
                    falling asleep with ideas, thoughts, opinions, innovations,
                    news, and other information. But students often struggle to
                    be sure what is real, which can lead to confusion and
                    anxiety.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One of the challenges which will come from heavy use of AI
                    in education is the risk of creating non-thinkers: an entire
                    generation who become used to outsourcing many of the mental
                    tasks people do today.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most countries make health education a top priority. We will
                    see digital education as equally important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The trouble is that generative AI simply amplifies a digest
                    of what it has read. Therefore, AI chat responses can easily
                    be hijacked by those promoting medical myths, dangerous
                    nonsense, and macabre rumours as facts, if they generate
                    enough content to influence AI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It will still be the case in fifteen years’ time that
                    software developers with deep insight, knowledge, and
                    experience of today’s coding platforms will have a
                    competitive edge over those whose entire experience of
                    coding since leaving university has been AI-driven.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is an absolute limit on the number of films the
                    average person is ever likely to want to watch in any year.
                    AI will create pressures on larger studios with high, fixed
                    running costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next-generation AI search may end up destroying the quality
                    of online content, causing it to degrade and go out of date,
                    by removing financial rewards for website owners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Future generations will find it really shocking that in 2025
                    most digital media was still completely uncontrolled in most
                    democratic countries, with vast proliferations of socially
                    damaging content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no doubt that AI will play a central role in
                    detecting and blocking unsuitable, undesirable, or illegal
                    content, and also in detecting the age of children or
                    teenagers who may be posing as adults.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The same AI tools being used to clean up media content
                    online will also be used to generate more harmful content,
                    with ever more sophisticated methods of encryption or other
                    ways of hiding it away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In future, many companies will introduce automatic bans on
                    all social media accounts which are not in the passport name
                    or social security number of the individual opening it,
                    publicly displayed on all postings, with name/address/mobile
                    phone number and other verification data to help certify the
                    account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expect a new wave of new ‘green-washing’ mis-selling claims
                    related to environmental investments linked to false
                    promises about capturing vast amounts of carbon, generating
                    clean energy, and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trust is absolutely fundamental to every business and will
                    be even more so in future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tomorrow’s websites will self-improve. Take a page which
                    advertises a new type of vacuum cleaner. AI will create
                    multiple ‘test’ versions of the page, and see how they
                    actually perform in natural search (no advertising).
                </li>
                <li>
                    AI will understand you better than you know yourself, when
                    finding the best possible fit between how you feel
                    personally and the leisure options in your price range.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As soon as AI is proved statistically to be safer, we can
                    expect insurance companies to start charging extra for every
                    ‘human mile driven’.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While some will prefer to have their own vehicles
                    permanently at their disposal, at least 20% of owners of
                    auto-driving vehicles will be delighted by 2040 to tap the
                    ‘SHARE’ button. This will release their car to pick up other
                    people, earning money on every hire. Such loaned vehicles
                    will be cleaned automatically as needed, at local centres.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All automated systems will be run by AI in future. Human
                    rules will not be needed, because AI will analyse data for
                    itself, make its own predictions and decisions. AI will also
                    try to detect fakes more rapidly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Retail banks will increasingly find themselves in
                    competition with financial management apps driven by AI,
                    providing customers with better account reporting and
                    financial planning, and an easier route to changing
                    accounts. These apps will also make it easier to manage
                    accounts with several banks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The more virtual our lives, the more personal contact
                    matters, and this will continue to apply to major financial
                    decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Privacy and security will remain top of the list of AI
                    concerns among senior bankers, and this will slow
                    implementation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will soon see astonishing accuracy in healthcare
                    predictions, linking genetics, lifestyle, and other data to
                    what actually happens in future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AI will be so accurate in predicting imminent health crises
                    that some people are likely to be denied health insurance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expect debate about making it illegal for insurance
                    companies to use such AI tools. The trouble is that these
                    same tools will be online for people to use before buying
                    insurance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    State surveillance will be taken to entirely new levels by
                    AI, with scrutiny of private lives on a scale never seen
                    before. The primary aim of all state surveillance is to
                    discover things going on in private lives or inside
                    organisations that could become a threat to the state,
                    however that is defined (including national or local
                    leaders, damaging revelations about government agencies,
                    etc.), enabling actions to be taken to prevent this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Countries most likely to use AI surveillance extensively
                    will be larger emerging ones with autocratic governments
                    such as China, Russia, or Saudi Arabia, and developed ones
                    such as the US, UK, and many in the EU, Australia, and
                    Japan, which will justify such activities as protecting
                    democratic freedoms. Countries such as India, Brazil,
                    Mexico, Nigeria, Kenya, Cambodia, and Thailand will use such
                    tools less widely.
                </li>

                    The power of surveillance is greatest when techniques remain
                    secret, which will mean using AI to develop new methods
                    faster than their discovery. The need to keep techniques
                    secret will often mean that police cannot prosecute, because
                    the risk of disclosure is too great. This will be a huge
                    issue: greater surveillance insights from AI, plus greater
                    reluctance by security services to reveal the extent of
                    surveillance. The result will be pressure to bend rules,
                    invent evidence, and circumvent legal processes, to ‘take
                    people off the streets’ who are considered a risk to the
                    state, without telling the truth as to why.

                    You could find yourself unable to interact online with a
                    group of friends that AI objects to, that it thinks are
                    unhelpful/disruptive influences – calls and digital links
                    blocked. Use of encryption-based social and digital links
                    blocked. Use of encryption-based social media or internet
                    searches, or VPNs, could result in fines or worse. Even if
                    encryption can’t be broken by AI, activity will be detected.

                    AI will be used to deliver a vast range of messages, often
                    subtle, tailored to each person, and so the ultimate
                    propaganda tools will be born. For example, we know that
                    text or images flashed for a fraction of a second in front
                    of someone’s eyes can sometimes change how someone thinks or
                    feels, without them realising.

                    Expect growing debates about who is a patriot, freedom
                    fighter, terrorist, or criminal.

                    By 2030, AI will also be used for assassinations, using
                    drones with facial recognition capabilities. Such drones
                    will only need a second or two at low height to confirm
                    identity before attack. With sharp blades, they will cause
                    fatal injuries to the head, without an explosive charge that
                    could kill others nearby.

                <li>
                    Perhaps the greatest AI danger we face in the future is our
                    own AI systems being deliberately turned against us as a
                    weapon. Not just one form of ordinary AI, but multiple
                    variants of Super-Smart AI.

                    At times of great tension, such fakes could help trigger
                    conflict. Hostile states will create all kinds of convincing
                    fake news – for example videos of police firing on unarmed
                    protestors. All to create a fog of disinformation, leading
                    to riots or worse. AI will be at the heart of such
                    deceptions.

                    A security officer can access all of someone’s personal
                    information relating to internet activity (searches, social
                    media, purchases), location, phone logs, family and friends,
                    employment, tax, immigration, banking, driving offences,
                    criminal record, health records – plus other insights
                    generated by AI-linked pattern recognition, predictive
                    analytics. Such an entity will become a primary target for
                    hostile countries to attack (and for ‘friendly’ countries to
                    quietly probe).

                <li>
                    This weakening will be accelerated by AI, to the point where
                    democracy is effectively killed off in several more
                    countries around the world by 2060.

                Although having criticized the book, I realy enjoyed my time
                reading it and think it is worth it for anyone interested in the
                topic.

                Just another kid with internet access…
            </h2>
            <p>
                For the most part of my life, I haven’t cared a lot about my
                online privacy, specially when I used to be a kid. I can still
                remember creating several online accounts and proudly filling
                all of them with my real private information. I didn’t care
                about what I was putting there, and I had no idea of what they
                were doing with all that. A kid like me would never imagine that
                those cool apps downloaded on my phone were in reality
                collecting all of my data and selling it to third parties to
                generate a profile of me and track my activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                But things change… and with change, new opportunities come into
                our way. So I naturally became more tech-savvy with time and
                learned more about the world that we live in. I started getting
                into politics when I was a teenager. I… think that’s normal for
                a teenager who has access to Twitter… I guess… but I have never
                felt like expressing my own ideas online, since I have always
                been very discrete and don’t like drawing too much attention to
                myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I started learning more about programming and other tech
                stuff, I came across a YouTube channel from a guy who used to
                work in Silicon Valley. Now, some of his videos are political
                and talk about some “weird” things he has seen during all these
                years working there. My intention here is not to get political,
                so I won’t be talking about my political opinions or what you
                should believe. My intention is to focus on the privacy side of
                things and why it matters to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, one thing that called my attention from this channel is that
                he used to work as a data scientist in San Francisco. During
                most of his videos, he would talk about why social media is
                dangerous and why we should stop using it. At first, I didn’t
                believe what he was saying and though it was just some boomer
                ranting online, but time proved he was right. In
                {$current_year}, I believe it is safe to say that most people
                who use the internet on a daily basis, would be able to come out
                with at least one negative thing about social media, and it’s
                impact on humans, specially teenagers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe most people who are reading this already know the
                problems associated with high phone usage, and that most modern
                apps are designed to be extremely addictive. That makes sense,
                since the more addicted you are to an app, the more data it is
                going to be able to collect on you, generating revenue for the
                company behind it. At this point, this is already basic
                knowledge for anyone who works in the field or has been using
                the internet for a long time.
            </p>
            <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
            <p>
                What some people seem to fail to understand is that this data
                collection isn’t only about generating an annoying ad before
                your next YouTube video, but about control. This harvested data
                can be bought and used by anyone to do almost anything they want
                with it, and after I realized the risks it can bring to my life,
                I started taking it a lot more seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I see someone or even myself advocating for online privacy
                on social media or in real life, a lot of comments received are
                from <del>stupid</del> people who have never studied about the
                topic, but like pretending they know something about it
                <del
                    >probably because they think the number of Twitter likes
                    they get is equal to their IQ score</del
                >, love to say that “<em>privacy doesn’t matter</em>” or “<em
                    >They don’t even care about you</em
                >” or the classical “<em>Nothing to hide, nothing to fear</em>”
                and, in my opinion, the worst of all: "<em
                    >They already have everyone’s data, dude, duh"</em
                >
                (this one only shows conformism from the person’s side. It isn’t
                even a valid argument). These comments show that most people,
                unfortunately, have no idea of what is being done to their data
                yet, and I don’t blame most of them. Some of these thoughts have
                already passed thought my mind in the past, and I agree that it
                can be difficult to see what is behind all of this massive data
                collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with all this is that, by knowing your interests, it
                becomes way easier
                <strong>to control you and exploit your weaknesses</strong>.
                Companies exploit it trying to sell you products, predicting
                your behavior (sometimes
                <a
                    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?sh=f10c63066686"
                    >future</a
                >) and use all these datapoints to build a profile of you that
                will be used and abused by marketing experts.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it was just about trying to sell products to me, I personally
                wouldn’t care much. At the end of the day, I always have my
                UBlock Origin extension installed and have no money to spend,
                but it does not stop here. Remember when I said that anyone can
                buy your data? Yes. The government can collect and buy it too.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don’t need to look back too long ago to see how much and how
                fast society has changed. People are more and more behaving the
                same way, consuming the same type of content, supporting the
                same ideas and hating the same people. Even though there are
                still different groups that combat each other ideologically (for
                example: left vs right), people who are part of these bubbles
                are told what to believe and what to fight for. This extreme
                polarization is beneficial for the government and for companies.
                The first will have faithful supporters no matter what. The
                second will squeeze the highest amount of
                <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pVDNBsC.jpeg">revenue</a> from
                them.

                Analyzing some of the events that have occurred not a long time
                ago, it doesn’t seem to me that we are heading towards a good
                direction. Governments are clearly abusing our data and using it
                to take authoritarian measures, as seen in China and recently in

                This is unfortunately a trend that is not going to stop any time
                soon. Actions like these will start happening more often and its
                consequences will be more harmful as people continue to
                integrate internet in every aspect of their lives.

            <p>
                This process of becoming privacy focused is not something that
                happened over the night to me. It was and still is being a slow
                process that takes effect little by little. I remember starting
                to switch to Linux after learning that Microsoft has keyloggers
                built into their system and that windows is a privacy nightmare.
                Of course, I didn’t completely wipe windows off my machine right
                away. I started with a dual boot, slowly migrating my files,
                programs and getting used to the system. This is something that
                I recommend to everyone: If you want more privacy,
                <strong
                    >don’t jump in headfirst. It should be a continuous and slow
                    process</strong
                >. You should feel comfortable with the changes you make and
                always try to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                After starting to switch to Linux, I started watching some
                videos about it, and naturally, I got in touch with the FOSS and
                privacy movement. I started watching a bunch of content
                creators, reading articles, listening to podcasts and replacing
                my apps with open source alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 2 videos in particular that I remember had a huge
                impact on me:
                <a href="https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=Y19RFmOxfVM"
                    >Go Incognito: A Guide to Security, Privacy &amp; Anonymity
                    | Front to Back</a
                >
                by Techlore and
                <a href="https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=94ENNlF_05k"
                    >Delete google from your life now</a
                >
                by The Hated One. Having access to these channels opened my eyes
                and made my “conversion” a lot easier. Then I started slowly
                removing google from my life. I started from changing some
                intrusive settings in my account until finally becoming prepared
                to flash a degoogled custom ROM to my phone. I still have a
                Google account, but it is not active at all. I moved from Gmail
                to ProtonMail, went from Google Drive to filen.io, from YouTube
                to NewPipe/Piped from Google Chrome to Librewolf, stopped using
                their search engine by choosing something private and set up a
                Bitwarden account to store all of my passwords. I have always
                tried to me a digital minimalist, so switching some services was
                not that big of a deal, it was just a matter of getting used to
                something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                With time, I stopped using social media, deleted all of my
                tweets, removed photos that contained my face in it and I don’t
                regret it. I love the fact that I don’t need to deal with all
                those schizos from Twitter anymore and don’t waste my time
                getting mad at them for posting cringe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another benefit of stopping to use social media is that you
                realize you have so much time to get your stuff done. If you
                still use it, I recommend installing an open source screen time
                tracker on your phone and testing it for one week. Depending on
                how many hours you spend, you might reconsider if it is really
                beneficial to you or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the internet, I follow the principle of “Everything you post
                of online can and will be used against you”. This is something
                that has been proved to be true, and even if you delete things,
                someone will find a way of bringing it back to life.
            </p>
            <h2 id="final-considerations">Final considerations</h2>
            <p>
                If I wrote here all the steps I take and all the tools I use to
                secure my privacy, this article would become a book, so I want
                to write a separate post just for that in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, with all being said, do I think that all this is worth it?
                Yes. Can it be done by anyone? Yes, but it depends on your
                threat model. There are people who can’t stop using social
                media, because that’s what they use to make money. Maybe some
                people need to use Google services because of college, work or
                whatever else. Some need whatsapp because everyone uses it, and
                their friends don’t want to switch to something better. No one
                on the internet will be able to tell you what is best for you,
                but it is important to know of the risks associated with the
                usage of these platforms, and how to avoid them.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to start taking your privacy more seriously, my
                advice is to start small. As I said, it should be something
                continuous and slow. See what you can do for yourself in your
                time and in your context. I bet you will see the benefits of it
                and won’t regret your decisions.

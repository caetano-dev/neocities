            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I am a computer science student and programmer. I like to talk about FOSS, digital privacy, cybersecurity
                (specially OSINT) and programming in general.</p>
            <p>I don't like social media, but if you want to reach out, you can DM me on Telegram @drull1000. I'll be happy to talk to you.</p>
            <p>After I graduate, I hope to be able to work remotely for another country and/or move to the countryside or abroad.</p>
            <p>Doesn't this gif bring you some inner peace? It does to me.</p>
